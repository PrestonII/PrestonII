### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Preston.

Professionally, I'm best described as a generalist. My skillsets range from design to code to buildings and I have a long history in the world of BIM. 

I love problem solving, collaboration and teaching.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as the Head of BIM Operations at Integrated Projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a ton about managing distributed teams, creating BIMs at scale and about various kinds of business models suited for the AEC world
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on literally everyting but specifically, folks that are interested in understanding more about HOW people create BIMs whether for design or existing conditions
